# repository is all of my python calculators as i learn python. this one is my first and simplest on my first day of learning python. 2 integers, 1 operation between them.
# will iterate and include new calculators until can make a calculator that does any combo of operations with any number of integers, although i think i can make it now i'll try later tonight
